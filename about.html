<h1> This is about us </h1>


     <p> Hello we are the website builders. My name is Shourya, and I am a student 
         that has recently started learning coding. Thrughout the first course, I found it 
         to be quite a challenge but soon started learning the way the pattern in the code
         works and how to manipualate the pattern to get the desired output on the screen. 
         Coding has taught me a lot of things about myself and the world around us especially the areas 
         that have to do with a technology or careers with a lot of technological apsects to them. 
         Right now the main thing I am learning about html and web-designing 
         and throughout what I have learnt so far I have shared so far with everyone
         on the Internet.
